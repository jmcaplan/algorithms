Grade for assignment [CaplanJason]: 10/10

very good work on the report, very good work overall, you may want to
compare the results on your machine with the results on my machine.

am pretty convinced that the issue is "logical cores"

We're going to see how your FJ implementation compares to a sequential implementation for various cutoff thresholds (expressed as a fraction)
