1. (1 pt) What is the value of the ﬂow f?

2. (2 pts) Perform one iteration of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, starting from the ﬂow f. Give the sequence of vertices on the augmenting path.
This single iteration must achieve the graph’s max-ﬂow (next question).

3. (1 pt) What is the value of the maximum ﬂow?

4. (3 points) Show (neatly!) the resulting maximum st-ﬂow by drawing the graph and annotating the ﬂow/capacity numbers for each edge in G. Your picture must resemble the original ﬁgure, with some changes to the ﬂow numbers in the numerator.

5. (2 pts) List the vertices on the s side of the minimum cut.

6. (1 pt) What is the capacity of the minimum cut?
